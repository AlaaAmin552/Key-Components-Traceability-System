# Increasing the Efficiency of OQC Lab

## Project Overview  
This project was conducted at **Toshiba El Araby** in **the industrial zone of Quesna** to enhance the **efficiency of the Outgoing Quality Control (OQC) lab**. The goal was to **increase the number of test samples for satellite TV models** by designing and installing a **Master Antenna Television (MATV) system**, addressing existing issues in the testing process.

## Problem Statement  
The main issue was that the **OQC lab could not test two TV sets simultaneously** due to the **use of an old LNB (single-way LNB)**. This setup caused signal distribution errors when more than one TV was tested.  
A secondary issue was the **use of welding wires instead of proper connectors**, leading to unreliable connections.

## Project Objectives  
- **Design and install an MATV system** to allow multiple TVs to be tested simultaneously.  
- **Provide 20 test points** to increase testing capacity.  
- **Save testing time** and enhance efficiency.  
- **Improve the accuracy of production** by increasing sample testing rates from **2% to 7%**.  
- **Prevent defective products from reaching the market** and reduce **customer PPM (Parts Per Million) defects**.  
- **Provide feedback to manufacturing (MFG)** for process improvement.

## Solution & Implementation  
### Approach  
1. **Identifying the Problem**:  
   - Visited the **TEVP** lab to analyze the current setup.  
   - Developed an action plan based on findings.  
2. **Designing the System**:  
   - Selected a **suitable LNB** that allows multiple TVs to receive signals.  
   - Chose necessary devices such as **amplifiers, multi-switches, and distribution units**.  
3. **Simulation & Validation**:  
   - Used **SatNet** to **design and simulate the system** before implementation.  
   - Selected **a power supply unit** and designed its PCB using CAD tools.  
   - **CAD tools used**:  
     - **Proteus**  
     - **Autodesk EAGLE**  
     - **Diptrace**  
4. **Implementation**:  
   - Installed the **MATV system** with proper wiring and connectors.  
   - Ensured **signal strength was evenly distributed** across all test points.  

## Results & Impact  
- **Increased test points** in the lab, allowing more TVs to be tested at once.  
- **Significantly reduced signal interruption issues**.  
- **Enabled future expansion** by allowing additional test points to be connected easily.  
- **Increased sample testing rate** from **2% to 7%**, leading to:  
  - **Improved defect detection** at OQC.  
  - **Higher production accuracy**.  
  - **Reduced market defect leakage**.  
  - **Better feedback to the manufacturing process**.
