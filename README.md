# Key Components Traceability System  

## Introduction  
Tracking key components is essential for ensuring **product quality, operational efficiency, and cost reduction**. This project at **TEVP** addresses critical challenges in the **traceability system**, such as serial number incompatibility, server downtime, and inefficient barcode scanning. To resolve these issues, we developed a **mobile-based traceability system** that enhances tracking accuracy, prevents production delays, and improves after-sales support.  

## Project Overview  
The project aimed to **enhance traceability** within the **TEVP production line** by implementing a **mobile-based tracking system**. The existing **SINOBI system** had several limitations, including **serial number length restrictions, server dependency, and inefficient scanning methods**, leading to **3% production downtime**. Our solution provided a **cost-effective, scalable, and efficient** alternative.  

## Problem Statement  
### **Key Challenges:**  
1. **Serial Number Incompatibility** – The existing system only supported **25-character serials**, while SKD models required **29-character serials**, leading to failed scans.  
2. **Production Downtime** – The system relied on **on-premise servers**, causing **3% production stoppage** during failures.  
3. **Low Open Cell (O.C) Tracking Efficiency** – Current scanners struggled to **read small serial numbers**, reducing tracking accuracy.  

## Objectives  
- **Ensure 100% traceability** for key components (**Open Cell, PCB, LCM, and TV sets**).  
- **Eliminate production downtime** caused by tracking failures (**reduce downtime from 3% to 0%**).  
- **Reduce costs** by **saving 53,000 EGP** in tracking system upgrades.  
- **Develop a mobile-based alternative** to the existing tracking system.  
- **Improve after-sales service** with instant access to component history.  

## Solution & Implementation  
Two solutions were considered:  

1. **Purchasing New Barcode Scanners** – Rejected as it **failed to solve long serial number scanning issues**.  
2. **Developing a Mobile-Based Tracking System** – Accepted as it **provided greater flexibility, accuracy, and cost savings**.  

### **Implementation Steps:**  
1. **Problem Identification** – Evaluated the **SINOBI system's limitations**.  
2. **Research & Solution Proposal** – Assessed different scanning and mobile-based tracking technologies.  
3. **Application Development**:  
   - Developed **"Traceability" App** for in-factory tracking.  
   - Created **"ElAraby Customer Service" App** for after-sales support.  
   - Integrated both apps with **Firebase real-time database**.  
4. **Testing & Optimization** – Conducted multiple trials to ensure system accuracy.  
5. **Deployment** – Implemented the system on the production line.  

## Results & Impact  
✅ **100% traceability achieved** across key components.  
✅ **Zero production downtime** (**downtime reduced from 3% to 0%**).  
✅ **Cost savings of 53,000 EGP** in tracking system improvements.  
✅ **Enhanced customer support** through instant access to component history.  
✅ **Improved technical expertise** in **app development and real-time tracking**.
